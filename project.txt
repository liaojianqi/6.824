5. The Raft Concensus Algorithm
    Raft basics
    Leader election
    Log replication


[]log first index is 1

why?
If leaderCommit > commitIndex, set commitIndex = min(leaderCommit, index of last new entry)

Once a follower learns
that a log entry is committed, it applies the entry to its
local state machine (in log order).

it includes that highest commited index in future
AppendEntries RPCs (including heartbeats) so that the
other servers eventually find out



commitIndex
log


TODO: 1失联又重新连接，leader只给他传了一个数据？？？？
